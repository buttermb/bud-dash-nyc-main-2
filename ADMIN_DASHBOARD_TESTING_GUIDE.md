---

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE TESTING

### Load Times
```
☐ Initial page load: < 3 seconds
  Open Admin Orders → Measure time
  Acceptable: < 3s
  Warning: 3-5s
  Problem: > 5s

☐ Tab switching: < 500ms
  Orders → Couriers → Live Map
  Should feel instant

☐ Data refresh: < 1 second
  Click refresh button
  New data should appear quickly
```

To measure:
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Note timestamps
3. Calculate difference

### Memory Usage
```
☐ Open Admin Dashboard
☐ DevTools → Memory tab
☐ Take heap snapshot: ~50MB
☐ Navigate between panels 10 times
☐ Take another snapshot: ~50MB
  ✓ Same = No memory leak
  ✗ Growing = Memory leak

If leak found:
  - Check for event listeners not removed
  - Check for subscriptions not unsubscribed
  - Check useEffect cleanup functions
```

### CPU Usage
```
While on Admin Live Map:
☐ Courier markers updating smoothly
☐ No frame drops (60 FPS)
☐ No CPU spike (< 50%)

To check: DevTools → Performance tab → Record 5 seconds
```

---

## 🔍 NETWORK TESTING

### API Requests Check
```
DevTools → Network tab → Filter: Fetch/XHR

For each request, verify:
☐ Status: 200 (not 404, 500, 401)
☐ Time: < 1000ms (not hung)
☐ Headers: Authorization present (if needed)
☐ Response: Has data (not error)
☐ Not duplicated (request shouldn't fire twice)
```

### Failed Requests Recovery
```
To simulate failure:
1. DevTools → Network tab
2. Right-click request → Block request pattern
3. Try action that calls API
4. Expected: Error message
5. "Try Again" button
6. Unblock (right-click → Unblock)
7. Click "Try Again"
8. Request succeeds

Expected behavior: App handles failure gracefully
Problem: If app crashes, error handling broken
```

### Realtime Subscriptions
```
Check Network tab under WebSocket (WS):
☐ Connection to Supabase realtime established
  URL: wss://... (Supabase project)
  Status: 101 Switching Protocols
☐ Connection stays open while using app
☐ No unexpected disconnects
☐ On disconnect, app tries to reconnect

If subscription failing:
  - Check console for errors
  - Check RLS policies
  - Check Supabase project connectivity
```

## 📋 ISSUE TRACKING TEMPLATE

When you find an issue, document it like this:

```
ISSUE #1
Panel: AdminOrders
Severity: HIGH
Title: Orders not updating when status changes in other tab

Description:
When I change order status in Tab A, Tab B doesn't update without manual refresh.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open AdminOrders in Tab A
2. Open AdminOrders in Tab B
3. Change order status in Tab A (pending → confirmed)
4. Watch Tab B
5. Status doesn't change (expected to update)

Expected Behavior:
Tab B should update automatically within 2 seconds via realtime subscription

Actual Behavior:
Tab B shows stale data, requires manual refresh (F5)

Possible Causes:
- Realtime subscription not working
- RLS policy blocking realtime events
- useAdminRealtime hook not subscribed

Solution Attempted:
- Checked Network tab: No WebSocket connection
- Checked Console: No errors

Next Step:
- Verify useAdminRealtime is being called in useAdminOrders
- Check if realtime channel subscription worked
- Test RLS policies allow realtime events
```
