-- Drop the insecure "Anyone can track with code" policy that allows bulk access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can track with code" ON public.orders;

-- Create a more secure policy that works with the view
-- This policy allows SELECT only when the query explicitly filters by tracking_code
-- Note: RLS policies don't have access to query predicates, so we'll use a different approach
-- We'll create a function that can be called explicitly

-- First, let's keep the existing policies that work and are secure
-- The "Users can view own orders or track with code" policy already handles user access

-- Update the view to be more explicit about security
